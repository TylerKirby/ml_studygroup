# Getting Started with ML

## Setup
1) Install [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (`brew install python` for macs)
2) Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/) with `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py`
3) Install [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) (`brew install pipenv` on mac, otherwise `pip install pipenv`)
4) Clone this repo and run `pipenv install` to install dependencies
5) Run `pipenv shell` to start virtual environment
6) Run `jupyter notebook` to start Jupyter server

We will mostly work from Jupyter notebooks so you won't need an IDE. But if you wish to do more serious Python
developement, then download [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The free community
edition includes everything you need.
